          "Read, read, read. Read everything -- trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a
          carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good,
          you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window."

          "Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the
          fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly."
